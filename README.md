# Jokes App - Simple Spring Boot Application

This is a simple spring boot backend application that will serve an index.html file when you hit an endpoint on your localhost `http://localhost:8080/joke`. The application uses an external dependency `guru.springframework:chuck-norris-for-actuator:2.4.0` to generate random chuck norris quotes. It is a simple html page which uses Thymeleaf to render out jokes.
